       My good friends Sean and Rachel

    <h2>
    I am new to coding and this webpage is a lil ode to my friend Sean (<em>Snen</em>) and his fiancee Rachel.<br>Below is a cool link I made. It takes you to my friend's website. 
    He sleeps weird so he needs one to help the outside world keep up with him.<br>

    <a href="https://isseanawake.com" style="text-align:center"> Is Sean awake?</a><br>

        In 2021 Sean asked Rachel to marry him and I'm very confident she said yes because she wears a ring now. I got to celebrate with them in Maine and it was the first time I ever made a pizza. <br>
        Life changing... for me... also life changing for them but because of the engagement not the pizza.<br>

        I rode up to Maine with Sean and Rachel and in the car we listened to lots of fun music. Some of the songs were in different languages. 
        Supposedly one of the songs in Spanish was about overthrowing the patriarchy.<br>
        I thought that was absolutely hilarious 1) that the song was about that and 2) that they had looked up the lyrics to learn that.<br>
        <em>Quite some time later</em> I learned that Rachel actually speaks Spanish sorta good so nobody ever looked up the lyrics haha<br>
        Sean and Rachel used to live in Boston because that is where Sean originally had a job out of college. They now live in NYC because Rachel landed 
        this super cool job at Google/Sidewalk Labs working on improving grid utilization and making energy usage greener! They are both very impressive in their own rights
        as good people and programmers.<br>
        One time we were sitting in Kali's house talking about how our parents would get us to do things with bribes. I told the story of my dad yelling at baseball games that
        he would get me a Subway footlong if I hit the ball. Then Rachel slipped in that when she did something good her parents gave her self esteem... 
        I kid you not I wheezed like it was my one-and-only passion in life. That was one of the funniest things anyone has ever said!
