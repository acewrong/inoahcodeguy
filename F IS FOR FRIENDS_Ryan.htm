    <h1> <!-- My good friend(s) XXXX-->
        My good friend Ryan
    </h1>

    <h2><!-- A quick blurb about where I know them from and why they are important to me. Include a joke and a picture.-->
        Most people that know Ryan don't realize it but he's deaf in one ear. He's not just a bad listener he's actuall... wait I think he is a bad listener but he does definitely try.
        I've known him ever since third grade and thankfully he's never left my life. Recently Ryan got married to Beth (we love Beth) and for his bachelor party we went to Zion National Park!
        Zion was the most beautiful place I've ever seen and the basketball we played at night was some of the most fun I've ever had hooping!<br>

    <p><!-- More details about things we have done together. External links are good here.-->        
        Ryan is currently in his residency at Wash U's hospital in St. Louis. He's working really hard there but I think he's still enjoying his life. 
        I think things are beyond good especially now that he's married. I was very happy to get to be a part of their wedding and I have never had so much fun at a wedding before theirs.
        <br>Ryan is a very important part of my life because I really look up to him. He's a very smart, kind, and enduring person. He wants to be the best he can be for himself and for others.
        One day I know he's going to make an amazing dad because he is patient and hard-working. Basically if I came up with every good quality someone could have I would assign it to Ryan. 
        This man really makes me happy and I miss him dearly. When I leave Boston I will consider moving to him as much as I would consider moving to my parents. He is my brother and 
        one of the few people for whome I would do anything. I love him and I always hope he is happy.
