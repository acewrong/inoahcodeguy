        When I first started getting to know Kali I thought she was superhuman because she does just so much stuff all the time (again lots of biking) 
        and I couldn't fathom her having the time or energy to get so much into each day! She also seems to write a lot of papers and TA for courses and 
        also write up new courses it's just ridonkulous yall.

        Kali and I have had some great adventures including trips to Maine, New Hampshire, and the happenin parts of Cambridge. 
        We also like to just hang out and I love when things are just chill at home with Avatar or a record player. Kali has brought 
        good vibes into my life and been an anchor during my transition period (read as <small>hard breakup</small>).
