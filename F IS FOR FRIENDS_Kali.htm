    My good friend Kali
    </h1>

    <h2 id="friendDesc">
        As my best friend up in Boston, Kali is doing such a great job of making me love it here!
<br>She is a student in the Tufts University <abbr title="Doctor of Medicine and Master of Business Administration">MD/MBA</abbr> (more than just one letter different from MDMA) program.<br>
    For a person in med school she does a lot of things that are super cool! She loves to bike (and now I do too), climb, and eat BAGELS. (see below for every bagel's last moments)<br>

        When I first started getting to know Kali I thought she was superhuman because she does just so much stuff all the time (again lots of biking) 
        and I couldn't fathom her having the time or energy to get so much into each day! She also seems to write a lot of papers and TA for courses and 
        also write up new courses it's just ridonkulous yall.<br>

        Kali and I have had some great adventures including trips to Maine, New Hampshire, and the happenin parts of Cambridge. 
        We also like to just hang out and I love when things are just chill at home with Avatar or a record player. Kali has brought 
        good vibes into my life and been an anchor during my transition period (read as <small>hard breakup</small>).
