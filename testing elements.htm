        I am new to coding and this webpage is a lil ode to my friend Sean (<em>Snen</em>).<br><br>Below is a cool link I made. It takes you to my friend's website. 
        He sleeps weird so he needs one to help the outside world keep up with him.<br>

        In 2021 Sean asked Rachel to marry him and I'm pretty sure she said yes because she wears a ring now. I got to celebrate with them in Maine and it was the first time I ever made a pizza. <br>
        Life changing... for me... also life changing for them but because of the engagement not the pizza.

        I rode up to Maine with Sean and Rachel and in the car we listened to lots of fun music. Some of the songs were in different languages. 
        Supposedly one of the songs in Spanish was about overthrowing the patriarchy.<br>
        I thought that was absolutely hilarious 1) that the song was about that and 2) that they had looked up the lyrics to learn that.<br>
        <em>Quite some time later</em> I learned that Rachel actually speaks Spanish sorta good so nobody ever looked up the lyrics haha
